# HUZPAD-MK1
Modular Windows macropad based on the Atmega32u4 microcontroller. Features a custom-designed PCB and a 3D-printed body. The main body houses the microcontroller and main PCB, which connects to the custom contact pads for module interaction. Current modules include a 5-key macro keyboard and an analog knob. Initially, an OLED module and a linear slider were planned alongside the previously mentioned modules. The design consists of up to four electronic modules and up to four future desktop organization addons that slot into the square intrusion. The modules are not hot-swappable, therefore an external software is necessary to configure the device. To combat this, I created a simple prototype desktop app communicating serially with the microcontroller, and further expansion of this solution will result in a more refined product. The PCB design requires further revision to ensure consistency and likewise, the physical design also requires revision to create a smaller footprint and a more secure connection with the modules. An updated version of this product would contain the previously mentioned revisions, as well as a lightweight desktop app for simple configuration and hot-swap capabilities. This project is used by me daily and it served as a great introduction to PCB design.
